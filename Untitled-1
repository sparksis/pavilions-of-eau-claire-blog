## Electical Feasibility Study

## Unit 111 - water ingress from planter

## Post-Construction Landscape Remediation

## Fire Deficiencies

## Planter boxes

### Why we should keep them

#### Safety

* Icicles and falling debris
* Vagrents
* Provides boundary preventing vehicles from coliding with the building

#### Elemental protection

* Greenspace lowers temperatures

#### Property value

* Good aesthetic
* The affected owners have been paying for quality of life for other tenants for years
* Can be seen as going green (replace with native greenery and remove irrigation).

#### No extra visitor parking needed

* de-urbanization from pandemic

* concesion: we could replace

### Why we should include full building

#### Heaving of retaining wall

#### Board negligence with regards to flooding (unit 111)

# TODO
