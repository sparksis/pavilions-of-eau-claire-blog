As with any condo, setting up your buzzer access is a small but key part in taking possession and moving in.&nbsp; As we quickly learned, it's best to double check everything.<br />
Steps involved in setting up a the door buzzer are as follows:<br />
<ol>
<li>Download the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.coltonenglish.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pavilions-of-Eau-Claire-Intercom-Request-Form.pdf">Pavilions of Eau Claire - Intercom Request Form</a> (or order it from <a href="http://www.condominiumfirst.com/documents_list.php?ccn=9810095&amp;fld=document_id&amp;sort=ASC" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</li>
<li>Manually print and fill out the form</li>
<li>Scan the form</li>
<li>Email the form to&nbsp;customercare.ab@fsresidential.com</li>
</ol>
Simple!<br />
Unfortunately, 17 days into our ownership of the unit, we're still not quite there.&nbsp; We quickly learned that&nbsp;customercare.ab@fsresidential.com can be replaced by&nbsp;Anna.Seck@fsresidential.com and Anna doesn't really care to answer emails quickly (or at all).&nbsp; Having submitted the form for the second time on&nbsp;October 17, 2017, Anna has just today (October 25, 2017) replied indicating that she had decided last week not to complete the work due to the number being inactive (news to me).<br />
<h2>
The full story</h2>
On October 2, 2017, we first submitted the intercom request form to customercare.ab@fsresidential.com with SMTP bounce backs.<br />
On October 3, 2017, we submitted the intercom request form to Anna Seck.&nbsp; When we took possession the following day we noted that the intercom still listed the previous owner on the intercom<br />
October 5-9, 2017, we were out of town visiting family for a wedding.<br />
October 10, 2017, I finally see our name on the intercom board and test the dial in to ensure it works.&nbsp; No ringing, no answer. After some troubleshooting locally, including verifying with my provider that no calls were missed; identifying instead that we submitted the wrong number.&nbsp; It's worth noting that at no point did Anna let us know that the intercom setup had been completed or confirm that the request had been received.<br />
Veronica sends a follow-up request indicating that the number is off by one digit and asked if it could be corrected.<br />
October 11, 2017, Anna a new email, not related to the first email with the following:<br />
<blockquote>
Good Morning Veronica,<br />
Thank you for getting in contact with me. Please see the attached document.<br />
Have a great day!</blockquote>
At this point we don't have the printer/scanner hooked up (or even moved to our new place) and are at a bit of a loss.&nbsp; Firstly I've directly asked&nbsp;<span class="lG">Lisa</span>&nbsp;Robbins, the community manager, if we could have more direct/clear communication.&nbsp; Secondly, it appears Anna doesn't seem to know how email etiquette works.<br />
October 13, 2017, We move in!&nbsp; (The printer is now here, but still not set up and has nowhere to go).<br />
October 17, 2017, We finally have our office setup.&nbsp; Veronica sends the corrected intercom request form directly to Anna Seck.<br />
October 24, 2017, Veronica sends a follow up to Anna Seck<br />
<blockquote>
Hello&nbsp;Anna,<br />
<br />
I would like to know when you think this will be completed by as we are expecting mail soon.<br />
Thanks,</blockquote>
October 25, 2017 (today), Anna Seck has replied with:<br />
<blockquote>
Thank you for getting in contact with me. Please be advised I have submitted the request, but we are having problems to connect the number that was provided. I called last week and it has stated the phone is not in service.</blockquote>
...<br />
<blockquote>
I will be away from the office from Thursday, October 26<sup>th</sup>, 2017 returning Monday, October 30<sup>th</sup>, 2017.</blockquote>
I have multiple&nbsp; problems with this reply.<br />
Problem one, Anna indicated that she has called "last week" but the phone is out of service, she has not communicated this issue to us for at least 3 business days.<br />
Problem two, the phone line is not out of service.&nbsp; I have retrieved a call detail report from my provider and there was no calls made to the number during the week of October 16-20, 2017.<br />
Problem three, Anna, the only representative who is working on these requests, will be out of the office for the rest of the week leaving me with no recourse aside from escalation for 4 more days.<br />
Evening October 25, 2017, I've sent the following email to Lisa Robins<br />
<blockquote>
Hi Lisa,<br />
<div>
I'm a bit disappointed to have received this email from Anna regarding our intercom request.&nbsp; Last week, Anna phoned the number listed on the intercom request form (attached) without success.&nbsp; Anna did not inform us of the failed test until we followed up with her this week.&nbsp; I had a hoped that, based on the positive response from our face-to-face, we would receive a bit better communication.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
From the screenshot below of my provider's detail records, you will see that I have confirmed the line works.&nbsp; Kindly, please have the number &lt;&lt;redacted&gt;&gt;&nbsp;configured as our intercom number.</div>
