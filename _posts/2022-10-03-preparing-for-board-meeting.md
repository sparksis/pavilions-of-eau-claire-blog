The 2022-10-04 condo board meeting is obviously tomorrow and I'm using this space to document my
goals for the meeting, and to draft the appropriate communications for the agenda.

### Goals

1.  Have the bylaw resolution be moved or terminated.

    1.  The bylaws were a contentious part of the AGM and I feel that they are a strong
        representation of the deliberate one-sided decision-making present in the past boards.

        Proposal:

        > I feel the vote has been dragging out far longer than the timelines. The topic was
        > contentiously brought up in the AGM having at least one owner indicating that the
        > method & means of communication left them feeling harassed.
        >
        > I would like to see us resolve the vote within this session.

    2.  For the sake of transparency, I feel all accepted forms of signing should be
        communicated clearly.  It was previously mentioned that we've moved to accept
        signatures via the phone.

        * How is identity being assured? Does it align with the guidance provided
          [by the government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/online-security-privacy/government-canada-guidance-using-electronic-signatures.html#toc2)?
        * What communications have been sent?
        * Have they been leading or intended to bias the result?
            * Leading statements include statements such as "just ..." or "simply ...".
        * Do they minimize the seriousness and severity of the changes?
        * May we have samples of the scripts used to ensure that leading and bias statements were
          not included?
