Hello world.

I'm recreating my blog of my life @ Pavilions of Eau Claire. This is mostly to chronical my attempt to improve the life
of my neighbors as I once again find myself unfortunately on the board @ Pavilions of Eau Claire.

My hope is that refreshing this blog will enable me to better unwind my thoughts and provide a more clear, thoughtful
approach when solving the problems I face living in this unfortunately place.

Some secondary goals for creating this blog are as follows:

1. Either recover old blog posts or document past losses further reviewing/critiquing my time living at pavilions of Eau Claire.
2. Documented news about Pavilions of Eau Claire and the surounding neighboardhood.
3. Possibly document the full extent of my financial losses related to the ownership of this condo.
